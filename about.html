            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>My name is Isaac Jerish, and I am a Computer Engineering student at Georgia Tech with a deep passion for embedded systems, hardware design, and software development. I’ve always been interested by how technology is so commonly integrated into our daily lives, and I love the challenge of creating solutions that require both hardware and software. My journey in engineering has been fueled by curiosity, hands-on learning, and a drive to create impactful projects, which I have built upon during my time at Georgia Tech.</p>

                    <h3>Early Life</h3>
                    <p>I grew up in Snellville, GA, where my interest in technology began at an early age. Whether it was tinkering with electronic toys, taking apart office supplies to understand how they worked, or experimenting with programming, I was always drawn to problem-solving. My early exposure to block coding and LEGO Robots played a significant role in shaping my passion for engineering. Over time, I realized that I wanted to go beyond just understanding technology, and explore design and building it myself.</p>

        <h2>Career Goals</h2>
        <div class="career-goal-item">
            <h3>Short-Term</h3>
            <p>In the short term, my primary focus is to gain hands-on experience through internships and coursework that will build a foundation in embedded systems and computer engineering. Ideally,I hope to land internships in embedded software or hardware roles with companies like Texas Instruments, NVIDIA, Lockheed Martin, or Apple, where I can apply and build upon my experience with microcontrollers, HDLs, and low-level programming. Additionally, I will be taking courses such as ECE 3030 (Intro to Computer Engineering) and ECE 4220 (Embedded Systems) to increase my understanding of embedded systems and software-hardware integration. I also intend to participate in undergraduate research through Georgia Tech’s ORS program or by collaborating with a professor on a project related to embedded systems or FPGA design.</p>

        <div class="career-goal-item">
            <h3>Mid-Term</h3>
            <p>By the mid-term, I aim to have a full-time industry position as an embedded software engineer, where I can apply my skills to real-world projects. My goal is to work with a company like Qualcomm, Tesla, NVIDIA, or Apple while focusing on areas such as firmware development, real-time operating systems, or low-power embedded design. In this phase, I plan to continue building my technical expertise by working on embedded projects and expanding my knowledge in specialized areas like RTOS, FPGA programming, and low-power system design. Networking with professionals in the field and obtaining certifications in embedded systems will also be important to accelerating my career and achieving my long term goals.</p>

        <div class="career-goal-item">
            <h3>Long-Term</h3>
            <p> Looking toward the long term, I aim to take on senior-level roles, such as a lead embedded engineer or systems architect, where I can lead the development of embedded projects. By this time, I hope to have gained experience in industry-leading companies, working in sectors like aerospace, automotive systems, or the Internet of Things (IoT). I will also look for opportunities to contribute to open-source projects and mentor younger engineers, sharing my knowledge with the next generation of embedded software developers. Depending on the direction of my career, I may pursue a PhD in Embedded Systems or Computer Engineering to go deeper into areas I enjoyed working on during my years in the industry. Ultimately, my main goal is to make a significant impact in the field of embedded systems, either as a technical leader in a major company, contributing to new technologies in a startup, or inspiring younger engineers.</p>
