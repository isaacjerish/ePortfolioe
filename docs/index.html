            <h2>Welcome to my ePortfolio!</h2>
            <p>My name is Isaac Jerish, and I am a Computer Engineering student at Georgia Tech with a passion for embedded systems, hardware design, and software development. My journey in technology has been driven by curiosity, hands-on projects, and a desire to innovate. With experience in HDLs, C, microcontrollers, Python, and more, I thrive in designing and building projects that include both hardware and software components. This portfolio showcases my technical projects, career aspirations, and personal interests—offering a glimpse into my journey and future goals. One quote I really live by is: 

                “The only way to do great work is to love what you do.” – Steve Jobs</p>
