                <h3>Discovery Project: Smart Plant Monitoring System</h3>
                <div class="project-details">
                    <h4>The Problem</h4>
                    <p>
                        The challenge was to create a smart plant monitoring system capable of tracking soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light levels while automatically watering the plant and integrating with a mobile app for remote control and monitoring. This concept was designed to improve plant care through precise, automated management.
                    </p>

                    <h4>The Process</h4>
                    <p>
                        I began the project with research on sensor technologies and their integration with microcontrollers. After evaluating several options, I prototyped various configurations focusing on sensor calibration. Although the initial goal was to integrate soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light sensors along with a mobile app, I encountered challenges, particularly with the light sensor calibration and app connectivity. During this process, I successfully implemented a reliable soil moisture sensor and achieved solid temperature and humidity monitoring, laying the groundwork for additional future enhancements.
                    </p>

                    <h4>The Outcome</h4>
                    <p>
                        While the complete vision of the smart plant monitoring system is still evolving, the project still resulted in positive results. The soil moisture sensor functions reliably and the temperature/humidity system provides consistent data. This proof-of-concept marks a step forward, as it demonstrates the potential for fully automated plant care and sets the stage for integrating light monitoring and mobile app connectivity in future updates.
